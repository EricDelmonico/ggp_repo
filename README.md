# Repo for GGP

Controls are:

O/P - Change camera FOV +/- respectively

M - Move entities--will look odd now that there's an actual scene, but you can see the shadows move this way

U - Offset UV's over time, not really necessary anymore as it's demoing a prior assignment, but it's there

L - Swap between the R2D2/Crate/TV/Guitar models and just a line of spheres. Line of spheres is convenient for playing with the size of the shadow map

J/K - Resize shadow map's world size to be smaller and bigger, respectively
